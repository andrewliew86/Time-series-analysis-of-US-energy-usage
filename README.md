# Time-series-analysis-of-US-energy-usage
Background: Forecasting energy usage is an important step in ensuring that the energy needs of the community. Energy usage often follows a seasonal pattern (i.e. usage peaks during the winter months) and future energy use can therefore be forecasted using time series analysis tools.

Results: I performed exploratory data analysis and was able to forecast energy usage by US residents over time using a SARIMA model. The results can inform decision makers and ensure appropriate resources are avaialble during peak periods.

Python libraries/tools: Pandas, Statsmodel (tsa models), matplotlib, pmdarima

Dataset was taken from here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/monthly-energy-consumption-by-sector
